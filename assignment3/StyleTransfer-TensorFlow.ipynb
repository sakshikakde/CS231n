We only care about the content representation of one layer of the network (say, layer $\\ell$), that has feature maps $A^\\ell \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times H_\\ell \\times W_\\ell \\times C_\\ell}$. $C_\\ell$ is the number of filters/channels in layer $\\ell$, $H_\\ell$ and $W_\\ell$ are the height and width. We will work with reshaped versions of these feature maps that combine all spatial positions into one dimension. Let $F^\\ell \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M_\\ell \\times C_\\ell}$ be the feature map for the current image and $P^\\ell \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M_\\ell \\times C_\\ell}$ be the feature map for the content source image where $M_\\ell=H_\\ell\\times W_\\ell$ is the number of elements in each feature map.

In an attempt to understand the types of features that convolutional networks learn to recognize, a recent paper \"[Understanding Deep Image Representations by Inverting Them](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.0035.pdf)\" attempts to reconstruct an image from its feature representation. We can easily implement this idea using image gradients from the pretrained network, which is exactly what we did above (but with two different feature representations).\n",

You're starting with total noise, but you should end up with something that looks quite a bit like your original image.\n",
